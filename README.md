Aether Grasp is an AI-driven educational assistant designed to help students who miss online classes catch up efficiently and effectively. The project allows users to upload recorded videos of their missed classes, which are then automatically transcribed into text using advanced speech-to-text technology. Once the transcription is complete, users have the option to generate a concise summary of the lecture to quickly grasp the key points. To enhance accessibility, the transcribed or summarized text can also be translated into the userâ€™s native language, breaking down language barriers in learning. Aether Grasp goes a step further by enabling students to interact with the content through a built-in Q&A feature, allowing them to ask questions and clarify concepts in real time. Moreover, the system includes an intelligent verification module that evaluates whether the summary accurately reflects the original content. With its blend of automation, language support, and interactive learning, Aether Grasp transforms how students recover from missed learning opportunities.
